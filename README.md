# Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) Art in Python

The intention of this repo is to provide a beginner-programmer-friendly way to enable people to make their own TSP Art using Python, and to highlight a few tips and tricks for bettering your art.

# Outline of Algorithm



# Requirements & Instructions

At the bare minimum you'll need installed:

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* Optional: [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) or any other appropriate image editing program. 

## Installation Instructions


## Producing TSP Art Instructions

### 1. Image Preprocessing

Skip this step if you're a first timer. This step will only be relevant after you've run through a few images and want to tweak things a little.

What can sometimes happen is that visually there is not enough comparative density between different sections of the image, making it hard to properly identify areas where an image is meant to have more shading. The way to fix this is to increase the contrast on the image, and this can be done in GIMP.
